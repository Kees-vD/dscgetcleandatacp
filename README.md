See the script for extensive documentation on the how the different steps of the
project assignment are implemented.

The script results in generating the file 'result_step5.txt' structured according to
the tidy data principles (course lectures/Wickham paper).

In order to run the script the data folder has to be set up as explained in the 
script.

Also see CodeBook.md (or the HTML rendering CodeBook.html).
